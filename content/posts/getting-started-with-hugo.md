Hugo is one of the most popular static site generators available today. Let me show you why it's so great!

## Why Choose Hugo?

### Speed
Hugo is incredibly fast. It can build thousands of pages in seconds, making it one of the fastest static site generators available.

### Simplicity
No need to worry about databases, runtimes, or dependencies. Just write Markdown and let Hugo handle the rest.

### Flexibility
Hugo supports various content types, custom layouts, and powerful templating. You have complete control over your site's structure and appearance.

## Basic Commands

Here are some essential Hugo commands you'll use frequently:

```bash
# Create a new site
hugo new site mysite

# Start the development server
hugo server

# Build the site for production

A typical Hugo project has the following structure:

- `content/` - Your markdown content files
- `layouts/` - HTML templates
- `static/` - Static files (images, CSS, JS)
